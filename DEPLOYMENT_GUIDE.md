## 🔧 Potential Issues & Solutions

### If site doesn't load properly:
1. **Cache Issues**: Clear browser cache and try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. **DNS Propagation**: Custom domains may take time to propagate (up to 24 hours)
3. **GitHub Pages Settings**: Verify repository settings > Pages > Source is set to gh-pages branch

### If routing doesn't work:
1. **SPA Routing**: The 404.html file handles client-side routing
2. **Relative Paths**: All assets use relative paths which should work correctly

### If images don't load:
1. **Asset Paths**: All images are imported properly in the code
2. **Build Process**: Images are included in the static build folder
